            <dd><b>Name:</b> BauBau</dd>
            <dd><b>Breed:</b> Shih Tzu</dd>
            <dd><b>Age:</b> 14 Years Old</dd>
            <dd><b>Personality:</b> Prince-like, having servants at his beck and call</dd>
            <dd><b>Background:</b> Ancestors served royalty all across Asia as professional feet warmers to 
               aid in a better night's rest.</dd>
            <p>BauBau has always been loved by everyone. The way he walks, his curious nature, 
               his natural cuteness - it makes it impossible to not fall in love with him. Even in his older 
               years when he's like an old, grumpy grandpa, he still charms all the strangers on his morning, 
               lunch-time, and afternoon walks. He tricks all the neighbors into thinking he's a slightly out-
               of-shape puppy when he's in fact 14 years old. It only makes people fall in love with him even
               more as he's still so energetic despite being an older dog. Little do they know how demanding 
               he is. He must have his morning and afternoon walks, no matter what the weather is. If it's too 
               cold for his old-man paws, he has a wagon that he demands to be strolled around in while snuggled 
               under layers and layers of blankets. When he has walked too much, he demands to be carried. 
               When he wants to get up or down from furniture, someone must help him. No matter how demanding 
               he is, he knows he can get away with it because of how cute and how much he is loved. But that
               doesn't mean he gets to avoid the vet. At the beginning of February, he had a vet appointment to
               check up on his food allergies and skin/ear infections. The vet had said he's in good shape and 
               isn't showing any more signs of allergic reactions, we were all estatic. The vet finished up 
               the visit by doing a routine check up. That's when she informs us he has a heart murmur and it's 
               quite sever. The vet informed us he shouldn't really be exercising or exerting himself due to 
               the severity of his heart murmur.

            <dd><b>Name:</b> Bubby</dd>
            <dd><b>Breed:</b> Terrier Mix</dd>
            <dd><b>Age:</b> 10 Years Old</dd>
            <dd><b>Personality:</b> Sewer rat, ball of affection and anxiousness</dd>
            <dd><b>Background:</b> Probably got swept away by a large storm into the sewer drains.</dd>
            <p>One day, my brother came home and announced to the family "We have a new dog." and presented 
               Bubby. Bubby was very skinny, very nervous, very scared, and shyed away from everyone - it looked 
               as if he was picked up from the side of the road or a sewer drain somewhere. Bubby's whole 
               life, he was physically abused - he had history of purple bruises, broken ribs, etc. When he 
               first came home, he did not look well and his personality reflected that. He was scared of 
               every one and peed in fear whenever anyone approached him. He stuck to my brother like glue. 
               However, my brother would often leave for school, work, or to socialize and Bubby would tip 
               toe into my room to look out the front window, waiting for my brother's return. The first time 
               he entered my room, I saw something out of the corner of my eye so I naturally turned to look. 
               Bubby had frozen mid-step and avoided eye contact. He very slowly and nervously licked his lips 
               waiting for me to turn away. I looked away and could hear him continue to tip toe to my bed and 
               wait for my brother to return. I eventually noticed that Bubby would often come out of whatever corner 
               he was hiding in when I fed BauBau. I realized my brother had not been taking care of Bubby and 
               neglecting him. I started feeding Bubby and taking care of him and he no longer waited for my 
               brother to come home. He had adopted me as his owner. Over the years, Bubby made a lot of progress. 
               He had a lot more confidence and barks whenever he sees violence to try and stop it, even if we were just messing around. 
               He stood up for himself when he was being mistreated. He no longer coward in fear around people. He came 
               out of his shell and was a huge, energetic ball of affection. A few weeks after BauBau had been 
               diagnosed with a heart murmur, I had noticed Bubby was acting strange. After a few days, he was 
               still acting strange so I called the vet and discussed with them on the phone. They had said it
               sounded like he had canine cognitive disorder (CCD). Essentially, Bubby was developing dementia. 
               That had explained why he was more anxious and nervous than usual. That had explained why he 
               didn't respond to his commands and name often. That had explained why he was less confident. That 
               had explained why his eyes had no light, he had lost what made him Bubby.
